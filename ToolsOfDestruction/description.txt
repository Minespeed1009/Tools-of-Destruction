Tools Of Destruction is a mod created by two developers, one is Minespeed, and the other, Mayhemm. This mod is based 
around the main item, Chaos Energy, and allows you to create many different things, including a post-Golem boss! 
This mod is still in development, so if you would like to support the creators, then join the discord by clicking
